# children-as-users

Andr√© Cardozo Sarli - January 2025

Children as users is a form of generative art. It seeks to depict how big technology platforms, such as social media and generative AI, deliberately do not acknowledge children as users because of the associated costs for protection and age-appropriated content. Ignoring children deals away with the problem by focusing the responsibility in the parents, pretending that a large part of their userbase is children. The mouse represents the technology companies and the white particles the responsibilities that come with having children using their platforms.
The particle system was created with the aid of Claude AI (version 3.5 Sonnet), which contrastingly state that children up to age of 17 are not authorized to use (in comparison with ChatGPT and Google Gemini). I prompted Claude to generate an interactive HTML5 environment where the particles avoid the mouse and form figures of children. The particles were later changed by small pictures with text inside.
